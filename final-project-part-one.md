# Outline
<p>
  One-sentence Project Summary:
  This project visualizes and analyzes the BPM, energy, and valence of songs used in Apple iPhone commercials (2017–2025) to reveal how Apple constructs a consistent and evolving sonic identity across its advertising.
</p>

<p>
  This project explores how Apple uses music in its iPhone commercials from 2017 to 2025 and what those choices reveal about the brand’s overall mood and identity. I collected the songs used in each advertisement and analyzed them using Spotify’s audio features, focusing on tempo (BPM), energy, genre, and valence. By visualizing these characteristics over time, I want to understand whether Apple follows a consistent musical style and how that style shifts as new iPhone generations are introduced.
</p>

<p>
  Through this work, my goal is to show how Apple’s sound choices support the emotional tone of its advertising. I am interested in whether the music has become faster, brighter, or more energetic in recent years and how those changes might align with Apple’s broader storytelling and product positioning. In the end, this project aims to highlight music as an intentional part of Apple’s branding rather than just a background element.

<h2>Project structure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Beginning = setting the context</strong><br>
    What does Apple’s iPhone commercials “sound” like, and how has that sound evolved/changed across iPhone generations?
    <ul>
      <li>Apple is widely recognized for clean, minimal, and trendy advertising.</li>
      <li>While visuals are heavily analyzed, the music in commercials is equally central to its brand identity.</li>
      <li>Brief description of dataset (2017–2025 Apple iPhone commercials, BPM, energy, genre, and valence of the music).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Middle = Data exploration</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Overview of the dataset (BPM / energy / valence ranges).</li>
      <li>Tempo (BPM) trends: line chart of BPM across iPhone generations.</li>
      <li>Energy patterns: heatmap of energy across iPhone generations / year.</li>
      <li>Valence shifts: bubble chart showing how mood of the music (brightness) changes over time.</li>
      <li>Genre trends: treemap showing the proportion of each genre.</li>
      <li>Combined audio profile: quadrant chart showing Apple’s overall sound identity in the commercials.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Climax = Insight</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Identification of Apple’s sonic identity: typically high BPM, mid-to-high energy, clean, modern, electronic-leaning sound.</li>
      <li>Does Apple lean toward a specific tone / genre?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Implications + Interpretation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple uses music strategically to shape emotional response.</li>
      <li>Shift toward more groovy and lower-valence music mirrors Apple’s focus on a charismatic, trendy brand identity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Closing = resolution and sync licensing relevance</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding Apple’s preferred audio profile helps explain why certain artists / genres are repeatedly chosen for their commercials.</li>
      <li>Sync teams pitching to Apple could strategically match music to the brand’s preferred BPM, energy, and valence characteristics.</li>
      <li>Analysis shows how data-driven insights reveal brand identity through sound.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

# The data
<p>
  To collect the dataset for this project, I first identified all iPhone models released between 2017 and 2025 and searched for their official advertisements on YouTube. For each commercial, I documented the song used in the campaign and gathered its basic musical attributes, including tempo (BPM) and genre. These values were obtained through BPM analysis tools and publicly available information on Apple Music.
</p>

<p>
  Because Apple Music does not provide audio features for all songs used in Apple’s commercials, I manually analyzed each track to categorize its energy and valence levels. This involved listening to the songs and grouping them into low, medium, or high categories based on consistent criteria. The result is a dataset that combines publicly sourced musical metadata with qualitative assessments of emotional tone, allowing for a more complete analysis of Apple’s advertising sound over time.
