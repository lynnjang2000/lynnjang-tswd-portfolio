## Target audience
My target audience would be artist management companies (talent agencies). 
As a market researcher, I aim to provide artist management teams with the data-driven insights that highlight the rising potential of female artists and identify actionable opportunities for scouting and development.

## Interview findings

| Questions                                                   | Interview 1 (Student A)                                                                 | Interview 2 (Student B)                                             | Interview 3 (Student C)                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Are the graphs effective and easy to understand?            | Rename the y-axis for the Billboard top solo artists graph                                 | Maybe add a graph showing the share of male artists by genre        | Changing the genre graph to a pie chart might be a good idea |
| Do the data correlate with each other or relate to the topic? | Data about solo artists in Billboard Top 100 may not directly relate, but you can blend it with other data | Rearrange the data for more effective storytelling                   | Interpretation will be crucial, especially if you're trying to highlight the positive side of female artist representation |
| Is the structure appropriate for the intended audience?      | This is very interesting data and analysis                                                | Yes, but rearranging the data could make the presentation more concise | Tightening the flow and grouping similar insights together could help the audience follow the narrative more smoothly. |

| Edit visualization and structure of the presentation | I will try out different versions of data visualization and refine them. I will also rearrange the data and analysis based on the structure of the presentation. |
| Convey clearer interpretation and analysis           | I will try to communicate my main point more concisely and focus on analyzing data that supports the overall topic of the presentation.   |
| Strengthen presentation flow and coherence              | I will refine the storyline of my presentation by connecting sections more logically and ensuring each visualization contributes clearly to the central narrative. |
